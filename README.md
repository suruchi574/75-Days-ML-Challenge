## Introduction.         
     
Hey there! I'm a passionate Data Enthusiast eager to dive deep into the world of Machine Learning. This "75 Days ML Challenge" is an ambitious  project where I commit to learning all the essential algorithms of Machine Learning and implementing them in a variety of captivating projects.

## What's the Challenge?  

Over the course of 75 days, I'll be immersing myself in the world of Machine Learning. I will be diving into topics such as linear regression, classification, decision trees, neural networks, computer vision and everything in between. My goal is to gain a deep understanding of these algorithms and, most importantly, to apply them in real-world projects.

## What to excpect ? 


Each day, I'll be sharing my daily progress. I'll post updates on what I've learned and the projects I've been working on. Expect a mix of code, explanations, and maybe even a few "aha" moments. By following my journey, you can learn alongside me or offer your insights and feedback.

## Why I'm Doing This? 

I believe that the best way to learn something is by Doing it. This challenge is not just about acquiring knowledge but also about building a solid foundation of practical skills. My hope is that this experience will not only transform me into a Machine Learning practitioner but also open up new opportunities for my personal and professional growth.

## Stay Tuned.... 


Follow this repository to stay updated with my daily progress, challenges, and achievements. Don't hesitate to join the discussions and share your insights. Let's make the most of these 75 days and embrace the world of Machine Learning!
